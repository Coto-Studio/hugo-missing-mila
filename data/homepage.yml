  title : "About the book"
  content : "
Margaret E. Ward tells a poignant and compelling story of this international adoption and the astonishing revelations that emerged when Nelson's birth family finally relocated him in 1997.


Ward vividly recalls the upheaval that occurred when members of Nelson's birth family contacted them and sought a reunion with the boy they knew as Roberto. She describes how their sense of family expanded to include Nelson's Central American relatives, who helped her piece together the lives of her son's birth parents and their clandestine activities as guerrillas in El Salvador's civil war.


In particular, Ward develops an internal dialogue with Nelson's deceased mother Mila, an elusive figure whose life and motivations she tries to understand.

It’s most basic strength is the raw emotional power of the story and the tremendous coincidence of the particular Salvadoran family to whom the author found herself connected by virtue of the adoption."

      content : "This is an articulate, sensitive and fascinating memoir of an international adoption in the early 1980's. Ward's account is heartfelt with the excitement and gratification of adopting a young Honduran boy, then subsequently learning how his early history was intertwined with the violence of civil war in Central America. She presents her individual family's account then adds research about the tragic 'lost children', the orphans of civil war in the region. The entire book is mesmerizing and touching. Highly recommend it!"

      content : "Highly recommend this very personal story of an American couple who thought they were adopting a two year old Honduras orphan. Fourteen years later they discover that their adopted son Nelson is really from El Salvador and that he is part of the thousands of children who disappeared during the Salvadoran Civil War. Set against the backdrop of this brutal conflict the books outlines with scholarly detail the journey of the adoptive and birth families who come together with much love to bond as one family. This is a book you will remember long after you have read the last page."

      content : "Several months have passed since I read Missing Mila, Finding Family, and this compelling true story told by Margaret Ward remains in my mind. Parents quickly called to Honduras to meet their to-be-adopted son, mystery surrounding the boy's previous life, the whirlwind of emotions unleashed by Nelson's birth family relocating him in 1997, and the families coming together and forming strong bonds, all grasp the reader's attention from cover to cover. Nelson's deceased mother Mila's elusive presence is central to the story, as is the backdrop of the Salvadoran Civil War, where Nelson's birth parents were involved in clandestine activities as guerrillas. Beautifully written, carefully researched, heartwarming, and very highly recommended."

      content : "Margaret Ward has written an extraordinary book about her family's international adoption. This true story is gripping and compelling. The author writes with scholarly accuracy and emotional clarity about her family's experiences. She details the history of the El Salvador dictatorship and the subsequent revolution. This book describes the journey of learning about their adopted son's family of origin and embracing them. Ward takes us on a remarkable journey of compassion, empathy and love.
      
      
The pinnacle of the book is the author's mental dialogue with her adopted son's mother and her wrenching decision to become a revolutionary while she was a mother.
The quality of the writing is superb and the lessons we take from this book are timeless and profound."

Margaret taught at Wellesley College in Wellesley Massachusetts from 1971 to 2010. She graduated magna cum laude from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania in 1965 and did her graduate studies in German Languages and Literatures at Indiana University in Bloomington Indiana, including two years on fellowship at universities in Berlin and Paris. During her tenure at Wellesley, she held the rotating William R. Kenan, Jr. professorship from 1995 to 1997. A prize in her name is awarded each year to an outstanding senior major in Women’s and Gender Studies in recognition of her contribution to the establishment of that department.


Professor Ward received NEH, Fulbright, and Mellon fellowships in support of her research and published on Bertolt Brecht, post-1945 political drama, and women’s biography. Her book, Fanny Lewald: Between Rebellion and Renunciation  (2006), based on extensive archival research in the former East Germany, was the first English-language biography of this prolific 19th-century German novelist, essayist, and early advocate of women's education and right to work.


Work on Missing Mila, Finding Family, began in 2004-2005 with a research trip to Central America. The book incorporates personal interviews, journal entries, letters, poems, blog posts, and photos, peeling back the layers of an unusual international adoption and describing how two families have become one. The author relies on the work of historians, investigative journalists and sociologists, but writes as an adoptive mother.
